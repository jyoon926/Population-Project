This is the worldwide production of energy, extracted or captured directly from natural sources. In comparison, the average energy use per capita in a year in the USA was <b><i><u>6.79762 tonnes of oil</u></i></b> in 2015. If all 7.7 billion people on Earth were to live like the average American, we would need around <b><i><u>3.7 Earths</u></i></b> in order to satisfy our current demands and desires.</p>

                    <p class="text">Another issue is water consumption. Fresh water is a limited and valuable resource on Earth, but our level of usage is extremely unsustainable. The withdrawal of freshwater per capita in the USA is around <b><i><u>1,600 cubic meters</u></i></b> per year. Roughly 0.4% of the earth’s water is usable and drinkable, which exists in lakes and rivers with a volume of <b><i><u>93,113 cubic kilometers</u></i></b>.
