        <h1>An Analysis of Global Energy Equality</h1>
        <p>With a rapidly growing global population, it is becoming increasingly important to use our planet's limited resources in a sustainable way. However, currently, there is a massive inequality in the distribution and usage of resources. Let's take a closer look.</p>

        <p class="text"><i>"Poor children still die by their millions. Westerners and the global rich live in post-scarcity society, while a billion people struggle to get enough to eat. And we're pushing the planet towards a tipping point, where the corals die and the forests burn and life becomes much, much harder. We have the resources to solve those problems, even now, but politics and economics and nationalism all get in the way.”</i><br><br>— Ramez Naam</p>

            <h2>Energy Consumption</h2>
            <div class="text">
                <p class="p">In 2017, the global energy output was <b>14,000 million tonnes of oil (Mtoe)</b>. This is the worldwide production of energy, extracted or captured directly from natural sources. In comparison, the average energy use per capita in a year in the USA was <b>6.8 tonnes of oil</b> in 2015. If all 7.7 billion people on Earth were to live like the average American, we would need around <b>3.7 Earths</b> in order to satisfy our current energy demands and desires.</p>
                <div class="math">
                    <p>6.8 x 7.7 billion = 52,360 Mtoe</p>
                    <p>52,341.674 million / 14,000 million = <b>3.74 Earths</b></p>

            <h2>Water Usage</h2>
            <div class="text">
                <p class="p">Another issue is water consumption. Freshwater is a limited and valuable resource on Earth, but our level of usage is extremely unsustainable. The withdrawal of freshwater per capita in the USA is around <b>1,600 cubic meters</b> per year. Roughly 0.4% of the earth’s water is usable and drinkable, which exists in lakes and rivers with a volume of <b>93,113 cubic kilometers</b>. If all 7.7 billion people on Earth were to withdraw as much freshwater as the average American, we would need around <b>130,000 Earths</b>.</p>
                <div class="math">
                    <p>1,600 m<sup>3</sup> x 7.7 billion = 12,320 million km<sup>3</sup></p>
                    <p>12,320 million / 93,113 = <b>132,312 Earths</b></p>

            <h2>Energy Equality</h2>
            <div class="text">
                <p class="p">A standard measure of inequality is the Gini coefficient, G. The Gini coefficient 0 ≤ G ≤ 1 varies from zero at perfect equality, where everybody receives an equal share, to one at extreme inequality, where everybody receives nothing, except for one person who receives everything. Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) for 1980–2010 show that the Gini coefficient has decreased from 0.66 in 1980 to 0.55 in 2010, indicating an increase in equality.

            <div class="more">
                <p>This graph shows that the Gini coefficient is now close to the theoretical equilibrium value of 0.5. The reason for this decrease in inequality is the increase in energy use per capita in developing countries. The US locates at the top of the Lorenz curve all over the years, where the energy consumption per capita is much higher than all the other countries.</p>
                <p>Although the decrease in energy inequality may seem to be a positive change, it actually proves that we are becoming increasingly unsustainable. Almost all the developed countries and developing countries are more and more relying on coal consumption, which makes energy more available, but also harms the planet.</p>
